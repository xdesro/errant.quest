my friends twirl and lindy to Glen Miller or Duke Ellington holiday renditions in the living room, and i overflow like coffee poured before catching a 6:30am train across Switzerland; dreamy and forgetful.

my friends trade leads and rock-steps while the clanging and clamoring of Luzern’s [uncountable church bell towers]{.hover data-img-target=belltower} carries on outside, disagreeing with each other about when precisely 22:00 actually is, like old men recalling the birth years of silver screen Hollywood starlets.

my friends carry on themselves, drawing the same runes with their feet that they’ve cast a thousand times before on the mirror-sheen planks of the dance floor back home. their spells are more potent and rare this evening, despite the somewhat austere setting of [this attic-level apartment]{.hover data-img-target=attic} *(we left the bar and the big band back in the States)*, but surely they must be! after all, aren’t we in Europe tonight?

[my friends]{.hover data-img-target=my-friends} dance with a centripetal force that could trap the world timelessly in its gravity, and it feels so good to be here with you, in the canopy of [this old Swiss town]{.hover data-img-target=lion} — to be dizzy from bells and train schedules, hearts full of stories and stomachs full of bread, and to love you so much.
