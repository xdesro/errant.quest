my friends twirl and lindy to Glen Miller and Duke Ellington holiday renditions in the living room, and i overflow like coffee poured before catching a 6:30am train across Switzerland; dreamy and forgetful.

my friends trade leads and rock-steps while the clanging and clamoring of Luzern’s uncountable church bell towers, arguing with each other about when precisely 22:00 actually is, carries on outside, like old men recalling the birth years of silver screen Hollywood starlets.

my friends carry on themselves for hours, drawing the same runes with their feet that they’ve cast a thousand times before on the mirror-sheen planks of the dance floor back home. their spells are more potent and rare this evening, despite the somewhat more austere setting of this attic-level apartment (we left the bar and the big band back in the States), but surely they must be! after all, aren’t we in Europe tonight?

my friends dance with a centripetal force that could trap the world timelessly in its gravity, and it feels so good to be here with you, in the canopy of this old Swiss town — to be dizzy from bells and train schedules, hearts full of stories and stomachs full of bread, and to love you so much.
