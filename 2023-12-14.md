well, Milan is shot on film; we’re making deals with pedestrian traffic and spinning the dials, shutter times and apertures between our thumbs like rosary beads in a quiet prayer that we framed that infinite teen couple kissing under the cathedral perfectly. well, i’ve been talking too much, trying loose-fitting punchlines till i even get on my own nerves cause when y’all laugh it adds a day to my life.

crossing the piazza to take [our photos of the church](){.hover data-img-target=duomo-di-milano} *(which everyone has taken) (but these are different of course, because we were really there!)* took an hour because dizzy pairs of Italians in brand-new-in-the-box love keep making time slow down with their cinema insistences and professions. every glamorous donna in Bottega boots and beautiful Milanese man in Dolce strutting like new gods of vertical aspect video — [i shoot them out-of-focus](){.hover data-img-target=out-of-focus} because my fingers are languorous at the thrill of people-watching; i keep expecting the camera to do the hard work, the careful work of details and accuracy. of course there’s more to it than that. trigger discipline for a Fujifilm x100v.

at the concert in the evening, Einaudi’s music spends its seasons at Walden; sends us into cel-animated fantasies as our minds sprint to explain why the cello keeps making us feel so cavernous, the caustic water reflections flickering onto our collarbones from the inside. 

well, it’s a sea of phones set recording between me and the orchestra — i’m unduly prideful, smug because half the attendees won’t remember exactly how the composer moved us in a language we’ve not learned but which we all understand, no matter how pixel-perfectly they try to capture it. 

<!-- your memory shoots out-of-focus because it’s your heart that turns the lens. -->
