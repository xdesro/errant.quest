there’s about a thousand steps between strada provinciale 583 down via coatesa to our villa apartment for the evening, and Adrienne takes them five at a time aboard winged chain loafers. our friends descend effortlessly behind her, sinuous and laminar waterfalls *mi scusi*-ing their way past villages into the lake, without disturbing a stone.

i am less graceful; a wound sustained during a recent battle with some asphalt — though you should see the other guy — has me rendering with nervous, low-framerate choreography, like a fresh tomato among our groceries seizing its moment of liberation to dive from the bag, shouting “viva la” slogans and manifestos as it ambulates unevenly and tumbles from step to perilous, non-Euclidean, cobblestoned Italian step.

a few hours pass and we read Rilke to each other, sandpaper translations into languages we can hardly pronounce. there’ll be red sauce and red wine on the table later, and the table pushed aside for Lindy later still, but now the kitchen is unrolled R’s and tense conjugations. in English and German and French and English again, we trade locked eyes and make fiery promises with each other to allow ourselves forever the fierce desires of youth:

> you see, i want a lot.  
> perhaps i want everything.  
> the darkness that comes with every infinite fall,  
> and the shimmering blaze of every step up.

windows open to cool the room and to listen to the lake pace the stone steps below. Milan tomorrow, and Florence the day after that.
