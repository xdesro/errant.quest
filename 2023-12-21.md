*(to a traveling companion)*

newest oldest friend, with your french language veins and open-throttle wrists; your watchful earnest moon that fills the sky and casts long tree shadows in bright December nights; that pleasant nocturnal stillness of northern-slope air that turns to steam in your mouth, that sideways-jawed, crunching bite of the slow first step into new snowfall in the half-dressed fir forest at midnight *(how immense such a quiet sound can be when all the world waits and listens for you to make it)* —

lightest sturdiest friend, if i am lucky enough to write the things that you feel without naming them, to pause on that forest walk to quietly compare hearts and be providential enough to find their shapes alike... if can somehow choose words that fit like bespoke, that are simply as good to read as they are to write, that move you with the same neck-turning delight and peculiarity that they move me,

then i’ll know they’re certainly the right ones.
