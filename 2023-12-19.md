it's already 2 by the time we’re off the train at Venezia Santa Lucia. the brash ~~onslaught~~ parade of boats through the grand canal tosses waves brusquely into scintillant crystal mists that soften our view of the pale green dome of the San Simeone Piccolo. December sunlight has decided upon exploring the labyrinth of Venice with us — furtive and curious we find it leaning against the corner at the end of each fantastically narrow street, or stepping out onto the top-floor balcony of every quintessential Venetian palazzo. 

dreamy film-grain piano arpeggios tumble carelessly from the pockets of Elise’s long winter coat as it unfurls melodramatically behind her. our party seeks a mythologized bookstore at the heart of this haunted city, one where they store books in boats for when the floods come, and the books in boats pile so high in the shop that they fade first to black and then to a heliotrope canopy of starlight. when we finally find it, the sun has long faded from the damp calli pavestones, but the yellow-gold light emanating from its open doors summons us like ghosts, and it's everything the fables promised: Escher staircases and precarious *(load-bearing?)* walls built out of ancient leather-bound tomes. everything's in Italian but it doesn't stop us from fluttering the pages like we'll have any idea. 

the atmosphere when we wander back out to the streets, laden with untranslated copies of books matched to each of our demeanors — Adrienne clutching her rare esoteric philosophical Elémire Zolla essays while I furrow my brow at individual panels of Peanuts® *in italiano* — has that late 1960s movie soundtrack weight to it, the breathy fluttering of a flute in its lowest register. the deep impasto blue of the evening is broken by the plunging hearts of amber and goldenrod street lanterns. on the walk back to the station, we peer into manor windows shamelessly, looking for salacious rumors of strangers' lives to sprawl ourselves upon, smug stray cats of Venice. 

bags stuffed with pages we can't read and heads lousy with wonder at this inexplicable and spellbound city; choosing a gelateria to end our day with is somehow the hardest decision we've made all week, and our return train to Florence leaves at 7:26pm.
